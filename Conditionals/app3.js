// 3. Suppose a situation in which you are expected to show ‘less than 10’ if a number is less than 10. However, if it’s greater than 10, print ‘greater than 10’. Also, deal with the case in which it’s equal to 10 with an appropriate message.


let number = 10;



if(number < 10){
    console.log("Less than 10");


}

else if (number > 10){
    console.log("Greater than 10");

}

else if(number == 10){
 console.log(" Number is equal to 10");
}

else{
    console.log("false");
}
